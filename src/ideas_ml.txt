assumptions:
since we do not posses the credit report of the customer, which plays one of the most important role in the credit decision, I will use some of the features that are usually available in credit report, and which are simple that a customer would be able to understand and input these values.

1. number of credit inquiries in last 6 months
2. number of open accounts
3. number of months since last delinquency
4. number of derogatory public records
5.
