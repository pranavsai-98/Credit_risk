Creating a lending/credit risk dashboard requires understanding of key metrics that are significant for assessing the performance, risk, and revenue optimization of a lending business. Here are some of the key visualizations you might consider:

Loan Portfolio Overview: This can be a series of graphs and charts giving an overview of the entire loan portfolio, including the total number of loans, total loan amount, breakdown of loan types, loan status (current, delinquent, in default, paid off), and number of loans by geography or demographic segment.

Risk Grade Distribution: If your institution uses a grading system for risk (for example, A-E, or 1-5), a bar chart or pie chart can show the distribution of loans across these risk grades. This can provide a quick look at the overall risk of your portfolio.

Delinquency Rates: These can be displayed as line charts, showing how rates change over time. You could break this down further by loan type, loan size, risk grade, or demographic factors. This will allow you to identify trends and potential issues.

Default Rates: Similar to delinquency rates, line charts can show how default rates have changed over time. Again, consider breaking this down by loan type, loan size, risk grade, or other factors.

Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD): These key risk parameters can be visualized in a bar graph or line graph to identify trends over time and by different segments.

Net Interest Margin: This is a key revenue-related metric for any lending institution. A line graph can show how this margin changes over time.

Revenue and Profitability by Loan Type or Segment: Bar graphs or pie charts can help identify the most profitable segments, which can inform strategy and product offerings.

Loan Volume or Revenue Forecast: Using historical data and statistical models, a line chart can project future loan volume or revenue.

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by Channel: This can show the most cost-effective channels for acquiring new customers, which can help optimize marketing spending.

Churn Rate: Monitoring the churn rate can help identify potential issues with customer retention.
